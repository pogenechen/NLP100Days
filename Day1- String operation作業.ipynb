CHECK WHEN WE ASKED FOR IT,/we aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just don\\'t get it,,,definitely lost the love after this one!/DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE,/the food is about on par with denny\\'s, which is to say, not good at all,/IF YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR MEDIOCRE FOOD AND DOWNRIGHT TERRIBLE SERVICE, THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU,/waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying,/WE WON\\'T BE GOING BACK,/the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it,/THIS PLACE LACKED STYLE!!/the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous,/DON\\'T BOTHER COMING HERE,/the meat was pretty dry, i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork,/THE BUILDING ITSELF SEEMS PRETTY NEAT, THE BATHROOM IS PRETTY TRIPPY, BUT I WOULDN\\'T EAT HERE AGAIN,/it was equally awful,/PROBABLY NOT IN A HURRY TO GO BACK,/very slow at seating even with reservation,/NOT GOOD BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION,/the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked,/THE CHIPOLTE RANCH DIPPING SAUSE WAS TASTELESS, SEEMED THIN AND WATERED DOWN WITH NO HEAT,/it was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor,/I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!!/this place is horrible and way overpriced,/MAYBE IT\\'S JUST THEIR VEGETARIAN FARE, BUT I\\'VE BEEN TWICE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS AVERAGE AT BEST,/it wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why,/THE TABLES OUTSIDE ARE ALSO DIRTY A LOT OF THE TIME AND THE WORKERS ARE NOT ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH THE MENU,/the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits,/CON: SPOTTY SERVICE,/the fries were not hot, and neither was my burger,/BUT THEN THEY CAME BACK COLD,/then our food came out, disappointment ensued,/THE REAL DISAPPOINTMENT WAS OUR WAITER,/my husband said she was very rude,,, did not even apologize for the bad food or anything,/THE ONLY REASON TO EAT HERE WOULD BE TO FILL UP BEFORE A NIGHT OF BINGE DRINKING JUST TO GET SOME CARBS IN YOUR STOMACH,/insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it,/IF SOMEONE ORDERS TWO TACOS DON\\'T\\' YOU THINK IT MAY BE PART OF CUSTOMER SERVICE TO ASK IF IT IS COMBO OR ALA CART?/she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door,/AFTER ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS I COULDN\\'T WAIT TO EAT HERE,,,,,,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!/del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible,/IT\\'S NOT HARD TO MAKE A DECENT HAMBURGER,/but i don\\'t like it,/HELL NO WILL I GO BACK/we\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant,/I DON\\'T KNOW WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS ABOUT THIS PLACE, BUT I WON\\'T BE BACK \"YA\\'ALL\",/i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar,/THE AMBIANCE ISN\\'T MUCH BETTER,/unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees,/THE FOOD WASN\\'T GOOD,/your servers suck, wait, correction, our server heimer sucked,/WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS PRETTY,,,,OFF PUTTING,/too bad cause i know it\\'s family owned, i really wanted to like this place,/OVERPRICED FOR WHAT YOU ARE GETTING,/i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch,/I KEPT LOOKING AT THE TIME AND IT HAD SOON BECOME 35 MINUTES, YET STILL NO FOOD,/i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to, and this tops the list,/WE STARTED WITH THE TUNA SASHIMI WHICH WAS BROWNISH IN COLOR AND OBVIOUSLY WASN\\'T FRESH,/food was below average,/IT SURE DOES BEAT THE NACHOS AT THE MOVIES BUT I WOULD EXPECT A LITTLE BIT MORE COMING FROM A RESTAURANT,/all in all, ha long bay was a bit of a flop,/THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT THEY CHARGE $11,99 FOR A SANDWICH THAT IS NO BIGGER THAN A SUBWAY SUB (WHICH OFFERS BETTER AND MORE AMOUNT OF VEGETABLES),/shrimp- when i unwrapped it (i live only 1/2 a mile from brushfire) it was literally ice cold,/IT LACKED FLAVOR, SEEMED UNDERCOOKED, AND DRY,/it really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down,/I WOULD AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU ARE STAYING IN THE MIRAGE,/the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland,/SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME SOME PLACE ELSE,/a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad,/THE PRESENTATION OF THE FOOD WAS AWFUL,/i can\\'t tell you how disappointed i was,/I THINK FOOD SHOULD HAVE FLAVOR AND TEXTURE AND BOTH WERE LACKING,/appetite instantly gone,/OVERALL I WAS NOT IMPRESSED AND WOULD NOT GO BACK,/the whole experience was underwhelming, and i think we\\'ll just go to ninja sushi next time,/THEN, AS IF I HADN\\'T WASTED ENOUGH OF MY LIFE THERE, THEY POURED SALT IN THE WOUND BY DRAWING OUT THE TIME IT TOOK TO BRING THE CHECK,'"
